Hello everyone! My name is **Andrey Starikov** and I've been a software engineer for 8 years already. Java is my go-to, but I'm always curious to try out new programming languages.

I've been working in big data for the last few years and it's very exciting and interesting.

Outside of the tech world, you'll find me exploring the world, taking pictures, and enjoying some outdoor activities like football and running. Tennis is my latest hobby â€“ it's a work in progress, but it's fun! Oh, forgot to mention, I also play guitar.

This blog is my spot to chat about software development, but not only. Apart from all things tech, I'm into social sciences, economics, so here in this blog I will also write about life lessons, soft skills, DeFi, recommend good reads, and just chat about whatever catches my interest.

So, if you're into tech, good vibes, and a bit of everything else, you're in the right place!

Welcome to my blog!
